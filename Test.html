    <h1>This is my first website in years! This is an h1 or header 1 element</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph, using the p element. Adding b or i elements to make words <b>bold</b> or <i>italic</i> respectively. Image element has no closing tag. Don't forget to add your !DOCTYPE html at the beginning of every project and also the html element. The head element is where you add all the invisible elements of the page, like title of page using the title attribute</p>
    <a href="https://youtube.com" target="_blank" title="This is the title attribute">This is a link using the anchor or the a href element. Adding target attribute with _blank will open the link on a new tab, hover for another attribute!</a>
    <p>This is an example of a line break, where you need to press enter<br>
        but add the br element at the end of the first line</p>
